Title: Queue ADT in C++ using Array Data Structures

Description: This repository contains an implementation of a Queue Abstract Data Type (ADT) in C++ using array-based data structures. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front. 

The implementation provides a simple and efficient way to create, manipulate, and utilize a queue in C++. It includes essential operations such as enqueue (to add an element to the rear), dequeue (to remove an element from the front), peek (to get the element at the front without removing it), and isEmpty (to check if the queue is empty).

The code utilizes arrays to store the elements, ensuring efficient memory usage and constant time complexity for most operations. It also incorporates error handling and handles edge cases such as queue overflow and underflow.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for C++ programmers who need to incorporate queue functionality into their projects or want to learn about the implementation details of a queue using array-based data structures. It can be used as a standalone library or integrated into existing codebases. The code is well-commented and structured, making it easy to understand and modify as needed.

Whether you're a beginner learning about data structures or an experienced developer seeking a robust queue implementation, this repository provides a reliable and efficient solution for managing queues in C++.
